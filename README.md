# Piwigo2WP

## Description
Include random images from an open API Piwigo gallery in your WP blog.

Based on PiwigoPress, a plugin that is no longer maintained.

This derivative is heavily stripped down and simplified. It only retains the ability to fetch and display random images.

## Requirements
For PHP 8, Piwigo 12 and above. Use PiwigoPress for older versions of PHP and Piwigo.

## Installation
Install folder piwigo2wp manually into your Wordpress plugins folder.

Activate, and then add a new widget.

Define gallery name, Piwigo gallery URL, and preferred size of derivatives.
